I want I want want. I want to connect all of my thouthts and ideas, to find them and access them. To explore them,  connect them and grow them. I want to plant them and tender them. 

**why do I want to do this?** 

To find my frequency. To find my frequency of creativity. To create things. To bring ideas to life.

To get these ideas out of my head. That is what bringing them to life means . 

to share my thoughts and ideas. (Why do I keep saying “thoughts and ideas” what is the difference?)  hahaha  what /

back to sharing, that is how I find all knowledge that I access. Through what other people share . This is humanity , this is our thing in life  

To fill my time. Not with filler. But with connection. Growth. Elaboration. 

Growth is key. That is why the human focus on productivity. It is in essence - growth. A ‘positive’ forward movement. An energy force. 

Energy. Motivation. Inspiration. Desire. 

 Mine stems from curiosity. Making new synaptic connections - feels good. 

**a further note on frequency**

It is a point of sensitivity. Of seeking increased sensitivity. Of allowing high fidelity sensitivity. This is when I can connect with / receive / sense the vibrations / ideas / messsages of others. Of my own. 

I believe that it is when I am open, relaxed, ‘not wanting’ that I am most open to my own frequency and can tune in to my own channel. 

But I ‘want’ to communicate on that channel in both directions. All directions. Transmit. Receive. Listen. Explore. Reverberate . 

**But how?**

I believe it is through the personal knowledge management system. I have been chipping away for the last two years.  

I have overcomplicated my systems of knowledge management and need to simplify things back to a base station. Perhaps starting on a lower frequency of simply writing. Write those thoughts out of my head. To fill the daily habit. Build the practice..

I need to publish my thoughts, start making them public, put them into a feedback system. Let them have a life so that they may grow. Not be trapped in my head. They need sunlight, water, nutrients. 

The sunlight is their visual appearance. The water is their flow and access. The nutrients are their feedback.  

What are my perceived obstacles?

I feel that there are a number of actions I need to take and systems I need to build. To find the frequency that allows me to transmit and receive feedback. 

It is almost as though part of my practice and training requires these acts to open up the channels that I need. Maybe this is true. Maybe this is not.  But I shall go through the process.

The system systems I’ve developed so far include my sea scrolls, which is my system of roles of craft paper for housing my ideas; markdown files, for writing and connecting thoughts and ideas of my own and of others; my Mac mini, to create store and connect digital knowledge, as well as generative, creative visual ideas; exercise, as a form of flow, to allow thoughts to generate and unwind and extrapolate through movement; (often supported by) Music, that I use to set a tonal environment, to inspire thoughts and ideas by tuning in to a variety in frequencies, to bring mood and passion and motivation; drawing, the absolute handmaiden of writing, with such a large percentage of the brain wired to support the hand as the communication tool, might practice will require a considered and regular percentage of time spent with both actions of the hand, that are creating written words to allow those parts of the brain flow, as well as the scribblings, the visual musings. 

**Bringing this all to life in a compact and sociable way**

 That would be to share as much of my creativity, in its rawest forms, need to do that I would use my fledgeling website, that until now I’ve been too scared to really jump into. sjtracey.com  

**Bottlenecks**  

Why is holding me back? What are my bottlenecks? Which is the first bottleneck to Tackle? 

(This idea of viewing life through bottlenecks is a new one, but I quite like it. The idea is that whatever you want to do will always have obstacles. Viewing them as bottlenecks means you have to tackle them one at a time. You have to do the immediate next bottleneck and solve that before unlocking access to the following ones. This forces the necessity to act on one thing at a time.)

**My bottlenecks are:**

- I have not set up the writing page on my website
- I have not set up the workflow to move from my markdown files into publishing direct through net and onto the website. 
- I wish to use obsidian more structurally and more thoughtfully, so a bottleneck here is to create templates for my writing.
- But the bottleneck before that, is making a tweak to my current Obsidian system, to utilize ‘bases’.
- So I need to study bases > create my templates > create a template for writing that I will publish > develop the workflow to publish to the website > publish.

Then, after that, I can work out how I want to share this and what other channels or frequencies (aka social platforms, forums, sites) that I might publish this information to. 

Take direct action like drafting and posting  these thoughts. Momentum. I can do very well when I have momentum. But my momentum is not an object or energy to acquire, it is a description of a state. State of flow and energy.  That comes from action. 

Fear. Not sure what it is then I’m fearful of. But perhaps it just could be success and liberation of the self. So there’s not much to lose.  

P.s Thanks Buster . For the encouragement of just starting raw unedited unpolished. Just go.  

*Marvin. K. Mooney will you please go now.*
