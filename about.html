  <h1>A creative home for showing and sharing my work</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my personal space online! I’m exploring web development from the ground up—starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and documenting every step of the journey here. I use <strong>Obsidian</strong> as my personal knowledge management system (my “exo-cortex”), so you’ll also see some published notes and reflections as I learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, this site is a canvas for my creative pursuits, from writing and drawing to more esoteric fields of interest such as the study of memory and an ambitious goal to create a Bestiary. Each section will reflect a different flavor of my curiosity, and over time, I’ll add new projects, experiments, and lessons learned.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re here to follow along, gain insights, share feedback, or just explore, I hope you’ll find something that sparks your own creativity, curiosity, and love of learning!
